## Devices used for Monte Carlo simulations
These devices is object of Device class stored in pickle format.

These devices are sampled from these parameters:
- `qubit_defect_rate(qdr)`
- `coupler_defect_rate(cdr)`
- `code_type`
- `code_size(d x d)`

In the favour of tunable coupler superconducting devices, we set qubit defect rate equal coupler defect rate.

## Samples
These samples are generated from SI1000 model with `p` specified.
