## Devices used for Monte Carlo simulations
These devices is object of Device class stored in pickle format.

These devices are sampled from these parameters, in the favour of tunable coupler superconducting devices:
- `qubit_defect_rate`: 0.02
- `coupler_defect_rate`: 0.02
- `code_type`: rotated surface code
- `code_size`: 21x21
