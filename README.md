This repo inlucdes an fully automatic adapter for the surface code on defective lattice.

## File Structure

- `/data`: Contains the data used in the article.
  - `/samples`: Contains the samples generated by Sinter sampler used in the article.
  - `/statistics`: Contains the statistics of the adapted surface code devices used in the article.
- `/defective_surface_code_adapter`: Source code of the adapter.
  - `/adapter`: Contains our adapter and a traditional adapter baseline.
  - `/analyzer`: Provides functionality for analyzing adapted surface code devices and obtaining statistics.
  - `/circuit_builder`: Builds stabilizer measurement circuits for the adapted surface code devices.
